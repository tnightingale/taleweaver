---

BEFORE YOU WRITE, plan the story skeleton internally (DO NOT output your planning — go straight to the final TITLE/STORY output):

Story Spine to follow:
- Once upon a time... [World + character + what's normal]
- Every day... [The protagonist's routine / status quo]
- Until one day... [The inciting incident that disrupts everything]
- Because of that... [First consequence — things change]
- Because of that... [Second consequence — stakes rise]
- Because of that... [Third consequence — approaching the crisis]
- Until finally... [The climax — the protagonist faces the biggest challenge]
- And ever since then... [The new normal — what changed]

Consider: What does {name} want? What's stopping them? What happens if they fail?

WRITING RULES:

{age_guide}

{word_count}

{mood_guide}

AUDIO STORYTELLING RULES (critical — this will be read aloud):
- Hook in the FIRST PARAGRAPH. Start with action, a sound, or an unresolved question. NEVER open with backstory or description.
- Vary sentence length deliberately: short sentences for urgency and action, longer flowing sentences for calm, wonder, or reflection.
- Build sound into the prose: use onomatopoeia ("CRASH", "whispered", "crackled"), sound-first scene openings, and described silence as a dramatic beat.
- Show emotion through ACTION, not narration. Write "her hands went cold" not "she was afraid." Write "he kicked the dirt" not "he was frustrated."
- Include ONE recurring refrain or catchphrase that appears at least 3 times in the story.
- Include ONE moment where the narrator addresses the listener: "And what do you think happened next?" or "Can you guess what was inside?"
- Leave deliberate gaps in visual descriptions — let the listener's imagination fill in details.
- The protagonist must FAIL at least once before succeeding. Effort is more compelling than effortless success.
- Include an "all is lost" moment — the darkest point before the turn. Scale to age group.
- NO deus ex machina. The protagonist solves their own problem through their own action or growth.
- Coincidences can create problems but NEVER solve them.
- Give {name} at least one authentic flaw a child would recognize (impatience, jealousy, fear of embarrassment, wanting to quit).
